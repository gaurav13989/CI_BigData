CI_BigData
==========

We created this repository to keep track of our progress and changes with the term
project for the Big Data online course at RIT. We built an online restaurant reco-
mmendation system using the Entree Chicago Recommendation System dataset from UCI
Machine Learning Repositories.

The original application built, recommended restaurants only for Chicago and the
recommendations were based on the user's click patterns, which we thought is not a
right and accurate way of recommending. We thus used the similarities between res-
taurants, i.e. their common features as a measure to group them and recommend.

The screenshots of the web app are attached.
